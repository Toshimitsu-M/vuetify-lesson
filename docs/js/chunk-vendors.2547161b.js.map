calling the\n * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.\n *\n * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *   enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *     // @return\n *     //   undefined: no action\n *     //   false: skip visiting this node\n *     //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether\n *     //   null: delete this node\n *     //   any value: replace this node with the returned value\n *   },\n *   leave(node, key, parent, path, ancestors)

kinds of AST nodes, or\n * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to three permutations of the\n * visitor API:\n *\n * 1) Named visitors triggered when entering a node of a specific kind.\n *\n

```\n *\n * 3) Generic visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving any node.\n *\n * ```ts\n * visit(ast, {\n *   enter(node) {\n *     // enter any node\n *   },\n *   leave(node) {\n *     //

A standard or normal presentation of a mathematical entity [or\n//    object]. A canonical form is an element of a set of representatives\n//    of equivalence classes of forms such that there is a function or\n//    procedure which projects every element of each equivalence class\n//    onto that one element, the canonical form of that equivalence\n//    class. The canonical form is expected to be simpler than the rest of\n//    the forms in some way.\n//\n// That's a long-winded way of saying any two objects that have the same\n// canonical form may be considered equivalent, even if they are !==,\n// which usually means the objects are structurally equivalent (deeply\n// equal), but don't necessarily use the same memory.\n//\n// Like a literary or musical canon, this ObjectCanon class represents a\n// collection of unique canonical items (JavaScript objects), with the\n// important property that canon.admit(a) === canon.admit(b) if a and b\n// are deeply equal to each other. In terms of the definition above, the\n// canon.admit method is the \"function or procedure which projects every\"\n// object \"onto that one element, the canonical form.\"\n//\n// In the worst case, the canonicalization process may involve looking at\n// every property in the provided object tree, so it takes the same order\n// of time as deep equality checking. Fortunately, already-canonicalized\n// objects are returned immediately from canon.admit, so the presence of\n// canonical subtrees tends to speed up canonicalization.\n//\n// Since consumers of canonical objects can check for deep equality in\n// constant time, canonicalizing cache results can massively improve the\n// performance of application code that skips re-rendering unchanged\n// results, such as \"pure\" UI components in a framework like React.\n//\n// Of course, since canonical objects may be shared widely between\n// unrelated consumers, it's important to think of them as immutable, even\n// though they are not actually frozen with Object.freeze in production,\n// due to the extra performance overhead that comes with frozen objects.\n//\n// Custom scalar objects whose internal class name is neither Array nor\n// Object can be included safely in the admitted tree, but they will not\n// be replaced with a canonical version (to put it another way, they are\n// assumed to be canonical already).\n//\n// If we ignore custom objects, no detection of cycles or repeated object\n// references is currently required by the StoreReader class, since\n// GraphQL result objects are JSON-serializable trees (and thus contain\n// neither cycles nor repeated subtrees), so we can avoid the complexity\n// of keeping track of objects we've already seen during the recursion of\n// the admit method.\n//\n// In the future, we may consider adding additional cases to the switch\n// statement to handle other common object types, such as \"[object Date]\"\n// objects, as needed.\nvar ObjectCanon = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function ObjectCanon() {\n        // Set of all canonical objects this ObjectCanon has admitted, allowing\n        // canon.admit to return previously-canonicalized objects immediately.\n        this.known = new (canUseWeakSet ?
